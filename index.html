    <h2 class="sc">Patronium — Polo Patronage Perfected</h2>
    <p>
      Patronium is the living token of patronage within the United States Polo Patrons Association.
      It is the medium through which honourable support is recognised and shared — not through speculation, but through participation.
      Every token of Patronium represents a place within the fellowship of those who uphold the game, its horses, and its players.
    </p>
    <p>
      It serves as the bridge between patron and player: a clear record of contribution and belonging within a high-trust community of sport.
      When a Chapter prospers, it offers tribute to those whose support made that prosperity possible.
      This is the essence of Patronium — recognition earned through genuine patronage and service to the field.
    </p>

    <hr class="rule" />
    <h2 class="sc">Charleston Polo — The USPPA Chapter Test Model</h2>
    <p>
      Each USPPA Chapter is a fully integrated polo programme operating under the Association’s standards.
      A Chapter begins as a Polo Incubator — a local enterprise where horses are gathered, pasture secured, instruction established, and the public welcomed to learn and play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once an Incubator achieves steady operations, sound horsemanship, and visible community benefit, it becomes a standing Chapter of the Association.
    </p>

    <hr class="rule" />
    <h2 class="sc">Founding Patrons and USPPA Patrons</h2>
    <p>
      There are two forms of Patronium holder.<br><br>
      <b>Founding Patrons</b> are the first to support the birth of a new Chapter. They provide the initial horses, pasture, and capital that make it possible for a Polo Incubator to begin. During this founding period, their Patronium receives the full measure of available tribute — a reflection of their patronage in helping to seed the future of the sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>USPPA Patrons</b> are the ongoing supporters who sustain and strengthen a Chapter once it is established.
    </p>

    <hr class="rule" />
    <h2 class="sc">The Tribute Framework</h2>
    <p>
      Each Chapter follows a principle of balanced and transparent patronage. From its net revenue (gross revenue less operational costs), a Chapter aims to follow this allocation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>51 % +</strong> retained for reinvestment — horses, pasture, equipment, and operations.</li>
      <li><strong>49 %</strong> max. available to the Patronium Tribute Pool, from which holders are recognised for their continued patronage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      During the Polo Incubator period, the Founding Patrons are whitelisted for direct proportional tribute from the Polo Incubators they support (49 % of tribute). <br>
      After the first year, or when the Incubator can support itself, it transitions to a full Chapter and the tribute returns to the standard USPPA Patron tribute.
    </p>

    <hr class="rule" />
    <h2 class="sc">Participation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Become a Founding Patron — assist in launching a new Chapter through contribution of capital, horses, or facilities.</li>
      <li>Become a Patron — support the USPPA and share in its ongoing tribute cycles.</li>
      <li>Provide Horses or Land — supply the physical foundation of the sport under insured, transparent, and fair agreements.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="rule" />
    <h2 class="sc">In Plain Terms</h2>
    <p>
      The Association seeks not to monetise polo, but to stabilise it — to bring clarity, fairness, and longevity to the way it is taught, funded, and shared. Patronium and the Polo Incubator model together create a living, self-sustaining framework for the game’s renewal across America.
    </p>
    <p>This is how the USPPA will grow the next American 10-Goal player.</p>
